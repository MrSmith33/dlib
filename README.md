dlib is a growing collection of native D language libraries useful for various higher-level projects - such as game engines, rendering pipelines and multimedia applications. It is written in D2 and has no external dependencies aside D's standard library, Phobos.  dlib is created and maintained by [Timur Gafarov](https://github.com/gecko0307).

If you like dlib, please support its development on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gecko0307) or [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/gecko0307). You can also make one-time donation via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/tgafarov). Thanks in advance!

**Important:** dlib doesn't support macOS. Please, read the [manifesto](https://github.com/gecko0307/dlib/wiki/Why-doesn't-dlib-support-macOS).

What's inside
-------------
Currently dlib contains the following packages:

* dlib.core - basic functionality used by other modules (manual memory management, streams, OOP for structs, etc.)

* dlib.container - generic data structures (GC-free dynamic and associative arrays and more)

* dlib.filesystem - abstract FS interface and its implementations for Windows and POSIX filesystems

* dlib.functional - some functional programming idioms (HOFs, combiners, etc.)

* dlib.math - linear algebra and numerical analysis (vectors, matrices, quaternions, linear system solvers etc.)

* dlib.geometry - computational geometry (ray casting, primitives, intersection, etc.)

* dlib.image - image processing (8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit floating point channels, common filters and convolution kernels, resizing, FFT, HDRI, animation, graphics formats I/O: JPEG, PNG/APNG, BMP, TGA, HDR)

* dlib.audio - sound processing (8 and 16 bits per sample, synthesizers, WAV export and import)

* dlib.network - networking and web functionality

* dlib.memory - allocators and memory management functions

* dlib.text - text processing

* dlib.serialization - data serialization (currently includes lightweight XML parser)

* dlib.coding - various data compression and coding algorithms

Supported Compilers
-------------------
dlib is automatically tested for compatibility with latest two releases of DMD and LDC. Older releases formally are not supported, but in practice usually are. There's no guaranteed support for GDC and other D compilers.

Documentation
-------------
Please, refer to [the wiki](https://github.com/gecko0307/dlib/wiki). Also HTML documentation can be generated from wiki pages using [this](https://github.com/gecko0307/dlib/tree/master/gendoc) set of tools. Be aware that documentation is currently incomplete. I'm currently running a [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/gecko0307) to reach $100 funding per month - help me get there to finish the documentation.

For quick support and overall discussions, use [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/gecko0307/dlib).
